## ⏸️ Deferred Features

### 1. OAuth Social Login (Google, GitHub)

**Status:** Not Implemented
**Complexity:** High
**Effort:** 3-5 days

#### Why Deferred
1. **Supabase Configuration Required**: Each OAuth provider needs to be configured in Supabase dashboard with:
   - Client ID and Secret for each provider
   - Redirect URLs configured
   - Testing and verification for each provider

2. **Frontend Changes**: Requires new UI components:
   - Social login buttons
   - Provider selection interface
   - Error handling for each provider
   - Callback handling

3. **Testing Burden**: Each provider needs:
   - Development app credentials
   - Production app credentials
   - Testing across multiple accounts
   - Error scenario testing

4. **Beyond Core Functionality**: Current email/password authentication is sufficient for MVP and production launch.

#### Recommended Implementation
When ready to implement:

1. **Choose Providers**: Start with Google (most popular)
2. **Supabase Setup**:
   ```bash
   # In Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Providers
   # Enable Google OAuth
   # Add Client ID and Secret from Google Cloud Console
   ```
3. **Frontend Code**:
   ```typescript
   // src/components/AuthForm.tsx
   const signInWithGoogle = async () => {
     const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
       provider: 'google',
       options: {
         redirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/callback`
       }
     });
     if (error) showToast(error.message, 'error');
   };
   ```
4. **Add UI**: Social login buttons in AuthForm component

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days for Google, +1 day per additional provider

### 2. User Statistics & Analytics Dashboard

**Status:** Not Implemented
**Complexity:** High
**Effort:** 5-7 days

#### Why Deferred
1. **Database Schema Design**: Requires new tables:
   - User statistics aggregate table
   - Game performance metrics
   - Time-series data for trends
   - Indexes for performance

2. **Analytics Logic**: Complex calculations needed:
   - Accuracy over time
   - Opening repertoire statistics
   - Mistake patterns
   - Improvement trends
   - Comparative analysis

3. **Visualization Components**: New UI components:
   - Charts (requires library like recharts)
   - Trend graphs
   - Statistics cards
   - Filtering and date ranges

4. **Data Migration**: Existing games need retroactive analysis

#### Recommended Implementation
When ready to implement:

1. **Schema Design**:
   ```sql
   -- User statistics table
   CREATE TABLE user_statistics (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
     period DATE NOT NULL,
     games_played INT DEFAULT 0,
     average_accuracy DECIMAL,
     total_mistakes INT DEFAULT 0,
     total_blunders INT DEFAULT 0,
     rating_change DECIMAL,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
   );
   ```

2. **Analytics Service**: `src/lib/analytics.ts`
   ```typescript
   export async function calculateUserStatistics(userId: string) {
     // Aggregate data from games and analyses
     // Calculate trends
     // Store in user_statistics table
   }
   ```

3. **Dashboard Component**: `src/components/StatsDashboard.tsx`
   - Use recharts for visualizations
   - Display key metrics
   - Show trends over time

**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days (schema + logic + UI)

### 3. Enhanced Bulk Upload with Parallel Processing

**Status:** Not Implemented
**Complexity:** Medium-High
**Effort:** 2-3 days

#### Why Deferred
1. **Complex State Management**:
   - Multiple simultaneous uploads
   - Progress tracking for each
   - Error handling per upload
   - Rate limiting considerations

2. **UX Challenges**:
   - How to display multiple progress bars
   - Handling partial failures
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Upload cancellation

3. **Current Implementation Sufficient**:
   - Sequential upload works fine for most use cases
   - Users typically upload 1-5 games at a time
   - No performance complaints

#### Recommended Implementation
When user demand justifies it:

1. **Use Web Workers for Parallel Processing**:
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/uploadWorker.ts
   const uploadGame = async (file: File, userId: string) => {
     const text = await file.text();
     const pgnData = parsePGN(text);
     await supabase.from('games').insert({
       user_id: userId,
       pgn: text,
       // ...
     });
   };

   // Parallel upload with Promise.all
   const uploadMultiple = async (files: File[], userId: string) => {
     const uploads = files.map(file => uploadGame(file, userId));
     const results = await Promise.allSettled(uploads);
     // Handle results
   };
   ```

2. **Enhanced UI**:
   - Individual progress bars for each file
   - Overall progress indicator
   - Success/failure per file
   - Retry failed uploads

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### 4. Unit Tests with Jest/Vitest

**Status:** Framework Ready, Tests Not Written
**Complexity:** Medium
**Effort:** 3-5 days

#### Why Deferred
1. **Framework Setup Needed**:
   - Install Vitest
   - Configure test environment
   - Mock Supabase client
   - Mock Stockfish Worker

2. **Test Coverage Strategy**:
   - Which components to test first?
   - Integration vs. unit tests
   - Mocking strategy
   - CI integration

3. **Time Investment**:
   - Writing tests for existing code
   - Setting up mocks
   - Learning curve for team

4. **Manual Testing Sufficient for Now**:
   - All core features manually verified
   - No bugs reported
   - CI ensures builds work

#### Recommended Implementation
When time permits:

1. **Install Vitest**:
   ```bash
   npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom
   ```

2. **Configure** `vite.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

   export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       globals: true,
       environment: 'jsdom',
       setupFiles: './src/test/setup.ts',
     },
   });
   ```

3. **Priority Test Files**:
   - `src/lib/pgn.test.ts` - PGN parser edge cases
   - `src/lib/stockfish.test.ts` - Engine mocking
   - `src/components/GameList.test.tsx` - Upload flows
   - `src/components/Toast.test.tsx` - Notification behavior

4. **Update CI** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
   ```yaml
   - name: Run tests
     run: npm test
   ```

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days (setup + core tests)

### 5. Component Refactoring for Reusability

**Status:** Deferred
**Complexity:** Medium
**Effort:** 2-4 days

#### Why Deferred
1. **Current Structure Adequate**:
   - Components are reasonably sized
   - No major duplication issues
   - Code is maintainable

2. **Premature Optimization**:
   - Refactoring before identifying patterns
   - Could introduce unnecessary abstraction
   - Risk breaking working code

3. **No Performance Issues**:
   - App loads quickly
   - No re-render problems
   - Bundle size acceptable

#### When to Refactor
Wait for these signals:
- Component file exceeds 300 lines
- Same pattern repeated 3+ times
- Performance issues identified
- New feature requires similar component

#### Recommended Approach
When refactoring becomes necessary:

1. **Identify Patterns**: Look for repeated code across:
   - Modal components
   - Card layouts
   - Button variants
   - Form inputs

2. **Create Atomic Components**:
   ```
   src/components/ui/
   ├── Button.tsx       # Reusable button
   ├── Card.tsx         # Reusable card
   ├── Modal.tsx        # Reusable modal
   └── Input.tsx        # Reusable input
   ```

3. **Refactor Gradually**: One component at a time

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 days (low priority)
